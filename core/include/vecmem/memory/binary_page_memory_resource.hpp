 * @brief A memory manager using power-of-two pages that can be split to
 * deal with allocation requests of various sizes.
 *
 * This is a non-terminal memory resource which relies on an upstream
 * allocator to do the actual allocation. The allocator will allocate only
 * large blocks with sizes power of two from the upstream allocator. These
 * blocks can then be split in half and allocated, split in half again. This
 * creates a binary tree of pages which can be either vacant, occupied, or
 * split.
