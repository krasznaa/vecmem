/**
 * @brief Downstream allocator that ensures that allocations are contiguous.
 *
 * When programming for co-processors, it is often desriable to keep
 * allocations contiguous. This downstream allocator fills that need. When
 * configured with an upstream memory resource, it will start out by
 * allocating a single, large, chunk of memory from the upstream. Then, it
 * will hand out pointers along that memory in a contiguous fashion. This
 * allocator guarantees that each consecutive allocation will start right at
 * the end of the previous.
 *
 * @note The allocation size on the upstream allocator is also the maximum
 * amount of memory that can be allocated from the contiguous memory
 * resource.
